# Introduction 

Welcome to the Teleport documentation! Teleport is available through the free,
open source edition ("Teleport OSS Edition") or a commercial edition
("Teleport Enterprise Edition"). 

Below is a brief summary of the documentation available here. 

## OSS Teleport 

The Open Source (OSS) Edition is [on Github](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport)

## Teleport Enterprise

Teleport Enterprise is built around the open-source core, with the added
benefits of role-based access control (RBAC) and easy integration with identity
managers for single sign-on (SSO). Because the majority of documentation
between the OSS Edition and the Commercial Edition overlaps we have separated
out the documentation that is specific to Teleport Enterprise. 

- [Teleport Enterprise Introduction](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/enterprise/) - Overview of the additional capabilities of Teleport Enterprise.
- [RBAC for SSH](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/ssh_rbac/) - Details on how Teleport Enterprise provides role based access controls (RBAC) for SSH.
- [SSO for SSH](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/ssh_sso/) - Overview on how Teleport Enterprise works with external identity providers for single sign-on (SSO).
